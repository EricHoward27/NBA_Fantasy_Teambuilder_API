## Project Idea

```md

## Other Info

The project was very fun to tackle, although it is only the first version of the cycle to complete the app. I do plan on continuing making updates to this app, and eventually make it a full fledge fantasy app to be used. I will post other info on the next versions here when it becomes available.
