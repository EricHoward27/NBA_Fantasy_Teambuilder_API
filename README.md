### Project Idea
I plan on creating a NBA fantasy team builder app. I love sports and thought it would be a good idea to build upon
a sport I love. This app is built for any sports fan who love the sport of basketball and even newcomers to the sport.

As a user, I can read the player's stats to help me compete in the league; 
As a user I can add players to my team; As a user I can remove any players off my team; 
As a user I can sign up to the fantasy app; 
As a user, I can sign in to the fantasy app;
